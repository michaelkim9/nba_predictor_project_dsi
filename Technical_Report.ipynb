    "The National Basketball Association (NBA) is widely considered to be the premier men's professional basketball league in the world and features some of the most well-known athletes. As is such, NBA players are the world's best paid athletes by average annual salary per player. And their increasing salaries have led to salary caps which limit teams' total salaries. This limit is subject to a complex system of rules and exceptions; therefore this is considered a \"soft\" cap."

    "## Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "In an effort to get an idea of what players are worth, judging strictly on quantative data, I am building a model to estimate player salaries based on on-the-court performance. The project is called \"Open Court\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Determining factors that influence NBA owners to pay players is of great importance in light of these financial constraints and dispute over salaries. When owners put out offers and sign contracts with players, how would they know that they're money is being put to good use? How do they know if they might be paying a player too much? Or if they aren't paying their players enough for their performence and thus risk losing them when their contracts end? Also, sports agents who represent their athlete clients can make a stronger case for higher salaries on their client's contract if they have hard evidence based on statistics showing their worth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of developing \"Open Court\" is to help settle disputes regarding NBA players' salaries and to identify the variables that are most likely to contribute to a player's salary. Unlike coaches who are mainly hired and paid based on a single metric (wins), players are hired and paid based on indvidual performance, which can be measured by their on-the-court metrics. Though there is a lot of literature regarding what determines NBA salaries, there is very little statistical backing to their claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "The development of Open Court is based on the hypothesis that a player's performance variables such as points per game, field goals, etc. would be significant contributors to player salaries. The dependent variable for this project was NBA player salaries and the independent variables were the offensive and defensive statistical categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rest of the job market, one's skill-set and the amount of experience they have using those skills determines salaries and with that information, applications like Glassdoor and Indeed can accurately predict how much a person would make for any given job. The plot below was determined with such information by Indeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "![programs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelkim9/nba_predictor_project/master/other_assets/averagesalary.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise with the NBA, I believe there are certain performance determinants that will offer an accurate prediction for salary. Perhaps teams put greater premium on points per game than they do on total rebounds per game. These kind of questions are what I hope to explore and answer."

I decided to only use the statistics from the 2016-2017 season as they would be most reflective of the current salary rates. The salary cap for the NBA has been increasing at a rate faster than inflation and so it wouldn't make for a good model to bring in statistics from multiple years. I thought about bringing in \"year\" as a feature so that the model would give weight to the year, as well as other features. But I wanted to stick to just statistical features to predicta single salary outcome."

    "The main limitation to developing this application is that only quantitative data was used. There are other intangibles that we can't account for in this model such as fan appeal, player's prone to injuries, or player's personality, leadership and impact on team morale. However, the model does highlight some trends and clearly shows that data can be used to determine NBA salaries. But these kind's of limitations are something that anyone faces in the normal job market. Applications like Glassdoor and Indeed predict salaries based on hard skills that are determined to be in greater demand. However, their models are limited too in that they are not able to capture intangible factors like a person's soft skills, leadership ability, team fit, business acumen, etc. But such applications are still useful tools that both employers and job-seekers utilize as it gives useful information on expected salaries given a certain type of skill-set. Likewise, Open Court functions as a similar tool for NBA team owners, athletes and their agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another limitation is that this model doesn't account for players who signed long-term contracts well before the 2016-2017 season. Therefore, their salary rate is determined by a prior season of play and isn't fully captured by just the 2016-2017 season alone. For the purposes of this model and project, I am attempted to just predict the 2016-2017 salaries based soley on basketball statistics from that season. "
