    "The National Basketball Association (NBA) is widely considered to be the premier men's professional basketball league in the world and features some of the most well-known athletes. As is such, NBA players are the world's best paid athletes by average annual salary per player. And their increasing salaries have led to salary caps which limit teams' total salaries. This limit is subject to a complex system of rules and exceptions; therefore this is considered a \"soft\" cap."

By the 2012-2013 season, the salary cap increased to 58 million and the average NBA player salary was 5.1 million.

    "## Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "In an effort to get an idea of what players are worth, judging strictly on quantative data, I am building a model to estimate player salaries based on on-the-court performance. The project is called \"Open Court\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Determining factors that influence NBA owners to pay players is of great importance in light of these financial constraints and dispute over salaries. When owners put out offers and sign contracts with players, how would they know that they're money is being put to good use? How do they know if they might be paying a player too much? Or if they aren't paying their players enough for their performence and thus risk losing them when their contracts end? Also, sports agents who represent their athlete clients can make a stronger case for higher salaries on their client's contract if they have hard evidence based on statistics showing their worth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of developing \"Open Court\" is to help settle disputes regarding NBA players' salaries and to identify the variables that are most likely to contribute to a player's salary. Unlike coaches who are mainly hired and paid based on a single metric (wins), players are hired and paid based on indvidual performance, which can be measured by their on-the-court metrics. Though there is a lot of literature regarding what determines NBA salaries, there is very little statistical backing to their claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "The development of Open Court is based on the hypothesis that a player's performance variables such as points per game, field goals, etc. would be significant contributors to player salaries. The dependent variable for this project was NBA player salaries and the independent variables were the offensive and defensive statistical categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rest of the job market, one's skill-set and the amount of experience they have using those skills determines salaries and with that information, applications like Glassdoor and Indeed can accurately predict how much a person would make for any given job. The plot below was determined with such information by Indeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"other_assets/averagesalary.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise with the NBA, I believe there are certain performance determinants that will offer an accurate prediction for salary. Perhaps teams put greater premium on points per game than they do on total rebounds per game. These kind of questions are what I hope to explore and answer."

For example, typically players will have more free throws than they do blocks. But the magnitude (or the number of free throws versus blocks) shouldn't determine the predictive power of the end result (salary). So I am going to scale the data so that the statistical variables are standardized by scaling to unit variance.\n",

    "#### More complex linear model: ElasticNet\n",
    "The R2 for the linear model was around 42% for the test data. The basic linear regression model may not be the best model given that basketball statistics and a player's performance have many variables and there are other factors that contribute to player's salaries. Building out a more complex model that includes these other factors could greatly improve the accuracy of our prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "But after building out this model, the ElasticNet didn't do that much better than the linear model. Actually, the basic linear model seems to have better scores and less error.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Random Forest Regressor\n",
    "Tried some more models - maybe the linear model isn't the best model for this data set. Tried using a Random Forest which should have a lot of benefits for our data. It's a non-parametric model - so it can predict variables that are non-normally distributed - which is our data as salaries do not follow a normal distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forests are a combination of tree predictors where each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The basic principle is that a group of “weak learners” can come together to form a “strong learner”. Random Forests are a wonderful tool for making predictions considering they do not overfit because of the law of large numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "After I implemented this model, the R2 score was lower and error was higher than the linear model. Though salaries follow a non-normal distribution and have a non-linear pattern, the same could not be said probably of the actual set of features (statistics), therfore the lower score than the previous linear models\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Extra Trees Regressor\n",
    "Tried another another tree method - Extra Trees. Seeing if this may produce better results than Random Forest. Looking at the results though, since this has a very high training score but significantly lower test score, the model seems to be overfitting. And so this model wouldn't be good for this data set. Also, the R2 is lower than that of the linear model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Support Vector Regressor\n",
    "Tried using a Support Vector Regressor to see if this may produce better results. But like the other models, it had a lower R2 score and higher error than the linear model.\n",

    "#### Neural Net Regression\n",
    "Developed a Neural Network model with Keras to see how well that would perform. As Neural Nets are primarily used for classification problems, I wasn't able to find a way to calculate the R2 score. Was able to find a way to use it for regression and calculate mean squared error. But comparing mean squared error to the linear model, it seems that the linear model still performed the best.\n",

Probably things like how marketable a player is, fan appeal, etc. There is more that goes into a player's salary than just their on-court performence but 42% is still enough that players definitely need to pay attention to their play.\n",

Our data set was relatively small to work with (limited by the number of NBA players for the 2016-2017 season).

    "# Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "The main limitation to developing this application is that only quantitative data was used. There are other intangibles that we can't account for in this model such as fan appeal, player's prone to injuries, or player's personality, leadership and impact on team morale. However, the model does highlight some trends and clearly shows that data can be used to determine NBA salaries. But these kind's of limitations are something that anyone faces in the normal job market. Applications like Glassdoor and Indeed predict salaries based on hard skills that are determined to be in greater demand. However, their models are limited too in that they are not able to capture intangible factors like a person's soft skills, leadership ability, team fit, business acumen, etc. But such applications are still useful tools that both employers and job-seekers utilize as it gives useful information on expected salaries given a certain type of skill-set. Likewise, Open Court functions as a similar tool for NBA team owners, athletes and their agents.\n",

    "<img src=\"other_assets/fan_appeal.jpg\" width=\"400\">\n",

    "Another limitation is that this model doesn't account for players who signed long-term contracts well before the 2016-2017 season. Therefore, their salary rate is determined by a prior season of play and isn't fully captured by just the 2016-2017 season alone. For the purposes of this model and project, I am attempted to just predict the 2016-2017 salaries based soley on basketball statistics from that season. \n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to create a useful model for predicting the salaries of NBA players based solely on their statistical performance in anyone year. Using data from the 2016-2017 season, I created a model which stands to explain how much players get paid according to their performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, another reason we created this model was to identify the variables that were most likely to contribute to NBA player salaries. We found that points and rebounds were the two main contributors to player salary. In other words, not only is it beneficial that a player have a high scoring average, but he must also be good at getting boards on both offense and defense. Assists and turnovers were also significant. Assists allows players to contribute to the overall points of the team and so it looks like teams are willing to pay a premium on assists also. And players who have an excessive amount of turnovers give their oppoenents more opportunities to score and thus becomes a liability to the team, therefore we saw a high negative coefficient for turnovers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all, players do not get paid according to their performance on the court only. A variety of other factors come into play, such as fan appeal and who represents them as an agent. Some team's management bodies tend to pay more, too. With that said, though, one can still produce a reasonably accurate statistical model predicting salary based solely on on-the-court performance, measured quantitatively.\n",

    "- Develop a model for rookie salaries - project \"DraftMe\"\n",
    "    - Rookies' salaries are determined by their position in the draft. And so we would need to develop a model that predicts where they'll be picked in the draft based on their performance before the NBA (which is their college statistics). I started the process of scraping college statistics but haven't build out a model yet to predict draft position.\n",
    "    - Once we know draft position, then there are already salary estimates for each position in the draft. And so rookies, even in their first 3 seasons in the NBA, won't be compensated based on their performance in the NBA but more prior to entering professional basketball."
