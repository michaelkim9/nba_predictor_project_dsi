    "The dependent variable for this study was NBA player salaries and the independent variables were the offensive and defensive statistical categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use the salaries and statistics of 486 NBA players from the 2016-2017 season. I decided to only use the statistics from the 2016-2017 season as they would be most reflective of the current salary rates. The salary cap for the NBA has been increasing at a rate faster than inflation and so it wouldn't make for a good model to bring in statistics from multiple years. I thought about bringing in \"year\" as a feature so that the model would give weight to the year, as well as other features. But I wanted to stick to just statistical features to predicta single salary outcome."

    "- Excluded were the salaries of rookies and those players who were still playing under their rookie contract (22). The rationale was that these player’s salaries are constrained by the rookie salary cap which is typically in force for three years. So if a rookie or a second year player performed well statistically, they would not be compensated accordingly because they are “locked” into a contract that may not reward them for their excellent play\n",
    "- The first model (Exhibit II) created includes every player in the NBA, and gives an R2 value of 0.4546. In other words, roughly 45 percent of the variation in salaries is explained in the model by the variation in the eleven statistical fields used. "

    "There are some features that are not related to on-court performence. There might be indicators that are related to past performence, like draft_position, which is related to how well a person did in college. But our model is more concerned about actual on-court performence at the professional level. And there are other fields that are simply not reflective of performence at all, such as shooting_hand, height and weight. So we are going to drop the following columns.\n",

    "#### Age versus Season Count\n",
    "\n",
    "From my previous notebook with EDA, seson count was a key indicator of whether a player was in their rookie contract. Age didn't really give any kind of relevant information. But season count had more explanatory power as it shows the fact that there were players who were restricted by the rookie salary cap. For rookies, their salaries are constrainted by the rookie salary cap which is typically in force for three years. Thus the swarm plot in our EDA notebook showed that there was a large swarm of lower salaries at season counts of 1-3. In order for our model to account for the lower rooke salaries, season count will be kept as a feature for the model to use, even though it isn't necessarily a performance statistic because this field will be needed to regualrize the model and to account for the rookie salary cap. We're going to drop the age field as it's too closely correlated to season count but of the two, season count seems to have more explanatory power. So dropping the age column. \n",

    "Currently, the data has total numbers for the entire season. For example, the feature \"PTS\" includes all the points that the player made for all of 2016-2017. However, this might not be entirely reflective of an individual player's performance compared to someone else's because the total number doesn't compensate for any lost statistics due to injuries of suspensions. Therefore, the columns that are indicated as totals are going to be divided by the total number of games that they played so that the statistics would be \"per game.\" And then, going to drop the columns that are related to the number of games or minutes that a player played as they aren't statistics related to player performance.\n",
